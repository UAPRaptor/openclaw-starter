## Ticket Backlog

Open tickets are tracked in `tickets/open/`. **All new work items should be created as tickets**, not TODO entries. Use ticket types:
- **TASK-NNN** — general work items (replaces TODO entries)
- **FEAT-NNN** — new feature requests
- **BUG-NNN** — defects and regressions
- **QUESTION-NNN** — clarification needed
- **EPIC-NNN** — groups related tickets into larger initiatives
